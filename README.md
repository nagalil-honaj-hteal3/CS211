# CS211
**Computer Science II - CSUSM**

*Pre-requisite for CS211 -- MATH 160 (calculus I) and CS111 or equivalent (must be comfortable writing programs with loops, functions, c-strings, c++ strings, arrays, files and structs).*

***Description:*** A continuation of program design and development.  Introduction to data structures: stacks, queues, linear lists, trees, and sets.  Includes pointers recursion, and implementation and analysis of sorting and searching algorithms.  Extensive programming is required.  Includes introduction to parallel models and algorithms, problem state space, relational database, and numerical approximation methods. 

**Mission:** This 4-unit course is a continuation of program design and development, focusing on object-oriented programming and software engineering principles. It covers the introduction to data structures: stacks, queues, linear lists, and trees. It also includes pointers, recursion, and implementation and complexity analysis of sorting and searching algorithms. Extensive programming is required.

The following material to be covered will be as follows:

***Review from cs111***
- return, pass by value, pass by reference
- arrays
- struct
- files
- 2-dimensional array (also known as matrix)
- string manipulation

***Searching and Sorting
